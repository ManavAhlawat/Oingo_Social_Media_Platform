# Oingo_Social_Media_Platform
Oingo is a web application that allows users to share useful information based on social, geographic, temporal, and keyword constraints.
Designed the relational database that stores all the information about users, friendships between users, notes
published by users, and filters that users have for what kind of notes they want to receive at different times and in
different situations (i.e., states, locations and tags).
Created a web-based user interface for the database designed in the first project. In particular, users can register,
create a profile, log in, post notes, and comment on notes they have received. Users can define filters for receiving
notes and are able to send and answer friend requests.
